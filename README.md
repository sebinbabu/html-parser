```
## Usage

Use the ```urlsniff help``` command to get instructions.

#### Example usage (and proof of endless possibilities)

* ```urlsniff https://google.com``` : grabs all URLs from google.com
* ```urlsniff https://google.com > links.txt``` : grabs all URLs from google.com and saves into links.txt
* ```urlsniff < links.txt``` : grabs all URLs from the URLs inside links.txt
* ```urlsniff https://google.com | urlsniff``` : recursively grabs all URLs from google.com (might fall into a deadloop)
* ```urlsniff https://google.com | grep books | urlsniff``` : grabs all URLs from the URLs grabbed google.com that contain the word 'books'

I mean come on, the last example must have blown your mind. Mine did too! Just look at the beauty of it. Like I said, endless possibilities...
